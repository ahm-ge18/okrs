        <h1>Rethink How We Design Our OKRs</h1>

        <p>
            While I'm not an expert in OKRs, I do play video games, and I think there's something we can learn from
            them. Even the laziest person can play a video game for hours on end. So, the question that begs itself: are
            they lazy, or is reality just a badly designed video game?
            <br><br>
            Video games keep players hooked by providing them with constant mini-wins. In real life, on the other hand,
            we tend to frame our goals as one-off big wins. These small and easy wins hijack our brains and keep the
            players going.
            <br><br>
            Like OKRs, video games have an overarching goal that's broken down into multiple objectives, key results
            (KRs), and initiatives. For example, let's say your objective is to enter a castle. To do this, you need to
            find a key, which is hidden in a farmer's room. The farmer will only let you into the room if you harvest
            his crops.
            <br><br>
            This is just a silly example, but it illustrates how video games use OKRs too. The key difference is that
            modern video games design their OKRs in a way to keep players hooked while maintaining their energy and
            psychology levels.
            <br><br>
            They do this by introducing breaks or relaxing moments in between, in the form of easier levels that come
            between difficult ones. These easier levels help players relax and recharge so they're ready for the next
            chapter.
            <br><br>
            We can apply this same principle to our OKRs by including easier objectives that help the team achieve small
            wins and recharge. Maybe we can extend these relaxing moments to a year-long level (instead of quarter-long)
            by alternating between quarters with hard objectives and quarters with easy ones.
            <br><br>
            We should also be mindful of the timing when we schedule these hard and easy objectives. For example, Q4 is
            a time of holidays, changing weather (doomy and gloomy), and year-end wrapping up. It's also a time for code
            freeze, which can make it difficult to get things done. Given all these factors, it makes sense to schedule
            easier objectives for Q4.
            <br><br>
            Based on this, we could aim for Q1 and Q3 to have hard objectives, while Q2 and Q4 have easy ones.
        </p>

        <p>Another option is to have Q2 and Q3 have the hard objectives, while Q1 and Q4 have the easy ones. This option takes into account the fact that Q1 has many similarities to Q4 in terms of holidays and weather.</p>

        <canvas id="myChartTwo" style="width:100%;max-width:600px"></canvas>

        <p>Whichever option we choose, it's important to be mindful of the team's energy and psychology levels. By introducing breaks and relaxing moments, maybe we can help them stay focused and motivated?</p>

        <p>Curious to hear your thoughts :)</p>
